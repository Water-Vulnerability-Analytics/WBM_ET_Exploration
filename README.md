# WBM_ET_Exploration

Validating the National Park Service (NPS) Water Balance Model (WBM) against
OpenET remote-sensing evapotranspiration and AmeriFlux/USGS eddy-covariance
flux towers, across the full nationwide list of flux tower sites with data
overlapping the OpenET period (2016–2023) — roughly 80 sites spanning most
major CONUS ecosystems. A separate side analysis (notebook 09) restricts the
same cached results to the smaller subset of sites within 50 km of an NPS
park unit, which was this project's original scope.

A concise, self-contained HTML summary comparing the Oudin and
Penman-Monteith WBM AET runs against OpenET and flux towers (live page via
GitHub Pages — see [Setup](#setup) below if it's not enabled yet). Source
file: [`reports/pet_comparison_report.html`](reports/pet_comparison_report.html).

## What this does

1. Selects the full nationwide list of AmeriFlux/USGS flux towers with data
   overlapping the OpenET period (2016–2023) — not restricted to sites near a
   park — and saves it to `Data/geo_data/flux_towers.csv`. Separately
   identifies the subset of those sites within 50 km of an NPS park unit
   (`Data/geo_data/flux_towers_near_parks.csv`), used only by notebook 09's
   side analysis below.
2. Pulls observed flux-tower ET, point-sampled and grid-cell-averaged OpenET
   (via Google Earth Engine), and gridMET daily climate for every site in the
   nationwide list.
3. Runs the NPS WBM (Oudin PET, degree-day snowmelt, bucket-style soil
   moisture) at a daily timestep, driven by gridMET.
4. Compares WBM actual ET (AET) to OpenET and flux-tower ET using bias,
   RMSE, and NSE, then attempts bias correction (direct AET correction, and
   a per-site PET-multiplier calibration).
5. Produces before/after comparison figures and exports a final metrics
   table.
6. (`notebook 06`) Runs a second, uncalibrated WBM configuration driven by
   FAO-56 Penman-Monteith instead of Oudin, and compares the two PET/AET
   estimates head-to-head. Penman-Monteith returns ETo (reference grass ET),
   not PET, and needs real wind speed — gridMET's wind (`vs` band, 10 m) is
   downloaded in notebook 02 alongside precip/temp and corrected there to
   the 2 m height FAO-56 assumes (`wind_ms` column). Notebook 06 applies a
   crop coefficient (`Kc = 1.0` baseline, easy to change) to convert
   ETo → PET before running it through the same WBM soil/snow/AET machinery
   as the Oudin run.
7. (`notebook 07`) Calibrates Penman-Monteith the same way notebook 04
   calibrates Oudin, but scales the crop coefficient (`Kc`) instead of a PET
   multiplier: a multiplicative `Kc` factor is fit against OpenET using only
   the 2016–2021 calibration period, at both per-site and per-ecosystem
   granularity, then evaluated on the 2022–2023 held-out test period. This
   tests whether Penman-Monteith's uncalibrated `Kc = 1.0` baseline was
   understating its potential accuracy, on equal footing with calibrated
   Oudin. Wind-speed dependence means, like the uncalibrated Penman-Monteith
   run, this variant still isn't usable with LOCA2/CMIP6 future-climate
   projections.
8. (`notebook 08`) Benchmarks *six* WBM AET variants — default Oudin,
   notebook 04's per-site- and per-ecosystem-**calibrated** Oudin,
   (uncalibrated) Penman-Monteith, and notebook 07's per-site- and
   per-ecosystem-**calibrated** Penman-Monteith — against OpenET (the same
   4 km gridcell ensemble notebooks 04/07 validate against) and against flux
   tower ET, producing per-site bias/RMSE/R² tables for every comparison. At
   nationwide scale (~80 sites) the figures are condensed rather than
   faceted per site: one scatter plot per AET method with a point per site
   (colored by ecosystem, panels for both OpenET and flux tower), example
   monthly timeseries for three representative sites (best/median/worst,
   ranked by calibrated-Oudin RMSE vs. OpenET), an ecosystem RMSE
   comparison, and a spatial map of which variant matches OpenET best at
   each site. Every calibrated-vs-OpenET comparison is restricted to a
   genuine 2022–2023 held-out test period, reporting mean/median/worst-decile
   robustness across sites rather than the mean alone, plus paired
   significance tests between the leading candidates. Read-only (no WBM run
   or GEE access) — just reads notebooks 02/03/04/06/07's cached outputs. See
   `reports/pet_comparison_report.html` for a narrative summary of results
   (currently reflects the four-variant design; the two calibrated-PM
   variants are not yet folded into the report — see Known limitations).
9. (`notebook 09`) A side analysis, not part of the main pipeline: reuses the
   exact same cached results as notebook 08, filtered down to just the sites
   within 50 km of a park. Since that subset is small (~35 sites), it keeps
   the original full per-site faceted figures (one panel per site) instead
   of notebook 08's condensed versions. No new GEE calls or WBM runs —
   read-only, like notebook 08. **Not yet updated** to notebook 08's held-out,
   six-variant design — still reports the original in-sample, per-site-only
   calibrated-Oudin comparison for the park-proximity subset.
10. (`notebook 10`) Water-balance implications: since AET is the WBM's
    primary outflow competing with runoff, quantifies how much switching
    from uncalibrated Oudin to per-site-calibrated Oudin or Penman-Monteith
    would change the model's simulated annual runoff, nationwide and by
    ecosystem. Read-only — reuses notebooks 03/04/06's cached daily WBM
    outputs (`RUNOFF` is already a per-day output column in each). Does not
    yet include notebook 07's calibrated-Penman-Monteith variants.

Each notebook caches its expensive outputs (GEE pulls, WBM runs, per-site
calibration) to CSVs under `Data/`, so re-running a later notebook doesn't
require repeating an earlier notebook's downloads. Within notebooks 02, 03,
04, and 06, this caching is now **incremental per-site** (via
`wbm.cache_utils`): each of those notebooks checks which sites are already in
its cache and only does the expensive work (GEE download, WBM run,
calibration) for sites that are missing, then merges the new rows in. This
means adding a new site to `flux_towers.csv` and re-running the pipeline
doesn't re-download or re-run anything for sites already cached — it only
processes what's new. (This resumes *across* runs, not *within* one: if a
run is interrupted partway through the new sites, that batch's progress is
lost and redone next time — see `wbm/cache_utils.py`'s docstring.)

## Setup

**Enabling the results report link above:** GitHub doesn't render `.html`
files inline, so the report needs [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
turned on once: repo **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source:
Deploy from a branch → Branch: `main`, folder: `/ (root)` → Save**. After a
minute it's live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/reports/pet_comparison_report.html`.
It also helps to set the repo's **Website** field (gear icon next to "About"
on the repo's main page) to that same URL — it then shows as a clickable
link right under the repo name for anyone landing on the page.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate wbm-et-exploration
```

This installs the geospatial stack (rasterio, geopandas, gdal), Google Earth
Engine (`earthengine-api`, `geemap`), and the scientific/plotting packages
the notebooks need. See the comment block at the bottom of `environment.yml`
for a pip-only alternative if you don't use conda.

You'll also need a Google Earth Engine account (free) — `notebooks/01` and
`02` authenticate interactively via `ee.Authenticate()`.

To sanity-check the WBM model code itself (no data or GEE needed):

```bash
python scripts/smoke_test_wbm.py
```

## Data

`Data/` is git-ignored — it's ~1.5 GB and everything in it is either
downloaded or regenerated by the notebooks themselves:

* **NPS park boundaries** — downloaded on demand from the NPS DataStore API
  (see `get_park_system()` in `notebooks/01_select_parks_towers.ipynb`).
* **Flux tower ET** (`Data/flux_ET_dataset/`) — the public Dryad/AmeriFlux
  "Post-processed CONUS eddy flux ET dataset" (Volk et al., 2023a,
  [10.5281/zenodo.7636781](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7636781));
  download separately and place it at `Data/flux_ET_dataset/` (see its own
  `README.md` once downloaded for the file layout).
* **OpenET / gridMET** — pulled via Google Earth Engine in
  `notebooks/02_load_flux_openet_gridmet.ipynb`, cached to
  `Data/open_et/`, `Data/open_et_gridcell/`, and `Data/gridmet_cache/`.
* **WBM rasters** (`Data/wbm_rasters/`) — elevation, soil water storage
  capacity, and Jennings temperature climatology GeoTIFFs. Used by
  `wbm.raster_io.load_wbm_rasters()`/`extract_point_params()` to sample
  per-site model parameters. These cover the full CONUS extent (confirmed
  against the nationwide flux tower list), not just the original six parks,
  so no new rasters are needed for the nationwide expansion.
* **Notebook 08 vs. 09 figure outputs** — notebook 08 (nationwide, condensed
  figures) saves to `Data/pet_comparison/`; notebook 09 (park-proximity,
  full per-site facets) saves to `Data/pet_comparison_near_parks/` so the
  two don't overwrite each other.
* **Notebook 07 outputs** — per-site and per-ecosystem calibrated-`Kc`
  Penman-Monteith results are cached to `Data/gridmet_cache/` alongside
  notebook 04's Oudin calibration outputs (`kc_site_*.csv`,
  `kc_ecosystem_*.csv`, `wbm_results_site_cal_pm_*.csv`,
  `wbm_results_ecosystem_cal_pm_*.csv`), following the same naming
  convention.

## Known limitations

* Every notebook (01→02→03→04→05, and 06→07→08/09) reloads its prerequisites
  from `Data/` at the top of the notebook, so each can be opened in a fresh
  kernel as long as the earlier ones have been run at least once. (Notebook
  04's calibration outputs — `OBJECTIVE`, `eco_metrics`, and the
  `metrics_*_vs_*` tables notebook 05 needs — are cached to
  `Data/gridmet_cache/` by a cell at the end of notebook 04; notebook 07's
  calibrated-`Kc` outputs are cached the same way for notebook 08 to read.)
* `reports/pet_comparison_report.html` reflects the four-variant design
  (default and calibrated Oudin, default Penman-Monteith); notebook 07's
  calibrated-Penman-Monteith variants are not yet folded into the report,
  notebook 09's park-proximity side analysis has not yet been brought up to
  notebook 08's held-out, six-variant design (see item 9 above), and
  notebook 10's runoff-implications findings don't yet include the
  calibrated-Penman-Monteith variants either.
* The incremental per-site caching (`wbm.cache_utils`, used in notebooks 02,
  03, 04, and 06) resumes *across* runs but doesn't checkpoint *within* one:
  if a run is interrupted partway through the new/missing sites, that
  batch's progress is lost and gets redone on the next run.

## Notes on reproducibility

* Two duplicate 120 MB park-boundary GeoJSON exports from the original
  class project were consolidated into a single
  `Data/geo_data/nps_unit_boundaries.geojson` (not tracked in git, per
  above) — both were byte-identical in content.
* `docs/` holds the original report, slides, project scope, and a
  reference PDF from the class project. It's excluded from git since the
  reference PDF is a copyrighted journal article; the analysis and results
  are documented in the notebooks themselves.
